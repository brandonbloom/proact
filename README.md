# Proact

Yet another UI Framework (in ClojureScript).

## Brief

I was building something like this before React.js came out. When I got scooped
on the render-loop / virtual-dom design, I went on to other side projects.
However, the time has come to revisit this and my abandoned design notes
featuring details that I feel no other project has gotten right quite yet. The
time is now because I've also got an application that I want to build and none
of the existing platforms exactly meet my criteria.

Watch this space or Twitter for updates, including motivation and design notes.

## Usage

Don't. At least not yet.

But if you want to play with it, there's a [partial TodoMVC implementation][1]
and [some driver code][2] for it.  Do the `lein figwheel` thing.

## Contributing

One thing you could contribute is a better name. Any ideas? :-)

Since this project is still in the incubation stage, I'm mostly interested in
contributions in the form of thoughtful discussions. Once the design principles
are validated and the API stablizes, I'll be interested in a wider variety of
contributions. That said, don't hesitate to reach out!
